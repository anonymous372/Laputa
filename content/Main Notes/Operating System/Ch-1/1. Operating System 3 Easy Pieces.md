## Three Pieces of OS are
* [[Virtualization]]
* [[Concurrency]]
* [[Persistence]]


#### ==Virtualization==
##### OS makes it easy to run program by allowing programs to share devices resources
##### OS provide [[System Calls]] to interact with the OS: 
	These are the APIs a process can call to get stuff done by the OS


#### ==Concurrency==
