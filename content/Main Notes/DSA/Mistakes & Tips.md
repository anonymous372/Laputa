# Mistakes
* READ THE QUESTION CAREFULLY 
	Take your time its better to be **"late & correct"** ✅ than being wrong ❌.
* First find the solution on PEN AND PAPER and VERIFY that it will work then only code.
* If using global variables make sure to clear/reset them when there are multiple testcases.
* If getting wrong answer, see the possible values the input can take probably you are missing some edge case (like 0) or some overflow.



# Tips
* When checking the bits of an int your like: `val & (1<<i)` i can go from `[0 to 30]`
	run loop like: `for(int i=0;i<31;i++) if(val & (1<<i)) //do smn`
